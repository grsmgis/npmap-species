This directory holds scripts for grabbing and managing species records from CartoDB.

separate.py will produce two products:

1. ATBI_counts.txt: contains species names and observation counts
2. ATBI_files: directory containing a CSV for each species in ATBI_counts.txt

The CSV files have a single header line followed by lines of the form:

   Genus_SpeciesMaxent [used by model, no spaces in name], 
   Genus_SpeciesIRMA [used to populate and link NPS metadata],
   GRSM_SpeciesID [used to sync with Park/NP Species, ITIS, etc...],
   CommonName [used to populate "info-window" pop-up in GIS web map],
   taxaGroup [used to split large # of files into folders for GH contraints],
   Subject [used to populate and link NPS metadata],
   Category [used to populate and link NPS metadata]
   LON,
